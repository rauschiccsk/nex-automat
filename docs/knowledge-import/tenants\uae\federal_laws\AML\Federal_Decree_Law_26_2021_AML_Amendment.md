## Key Amendments

### Article 1 - Updated Definitions

**New/Modified Definitions:**

**Suspicious Transactions:** Transactions related to funds for which there are **reasonable grounds to believe** that they are earned from any felony or misdemeanor or related to the financing of terrorism or of illegal organizations, whether committed or attempted.

*Note: Changed from "reasonable grounds to suspect" to "reasonable grounds to believe" - subtle but potentially significant linguistic change.*

**Virtual Assets:** A digital representation of the value that can be digitally traded or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes.

**Virtual Asset Service Providers:** Any natural or legal person, who practices any activity of commercial business, conducts one or more of the activities of virtual assets specified in the Executive Regulation.

**Funds:** [Expanded definition] Assets, whatever the method of acquisition, type and form, tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, **electronic, digital or encrypted**, including local and foreign currencies, legal documents and instruments of whatever form, including electronic or digital form...

**Beneficial Owner:** [Clarified] The natural person who owns or exercises effective ultimate control over the client... **whether directly or through a chain of ownership, control or other indirect means.**

### Article 2 - Money Laundering Definition

**[NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE TO CORE DEFINITION]**

1. Any person, **having the knowledge** that the funds are the proceeds of a felony or a misdemeanour, and who **wilfully** commits any of the following acts, shall be considered a perpetrator of the crime of Money Laundering:

   a) Transferring or moving proceeds or conducting any transaction with the aim of concealing or disguising their Illegal source.

   b) Concealing or disguising the true nature, source or location of the proceeds as well as the method involving their disposition, movement, ownership of or rights with respect to said proceeds.

   c) Acquiring, possessing or using proceeds upon receipt.

   d) Assisting the perpetrator of the predicate offense to escape punishment.

2. The crime of Money Laundering is considered as an independent crime. The punishment of the perpetrator for the predicate offence shall not prevent his punishment for the crime of Money Laundering.

3. Proving the illicit source of the proceeds should not constitute a prerequisite to sentencing the perpetrator of the predicate offence.

**IMPORTANT:** The knowledge requirement ("having the knowledge") remains unchanged from the 2018 law. The newer 2025 law significantly changes this to include "sufficient evidence or circumstantial evidence."

### NEW Article 25 bis - Possession with Sufficient Evidence

**[CRITICAL NEW PROVISION]**

> Imprisonment for no less than (3) three months and a penalty of no less than AED 50,000 (fifty thousand dirham) or any of these two sanctions shall apply to **whoever possesses, conceals or performs any operation of funds when there is sufficient evidence or presumption of the illegality of its source.**

> Upon conviction, the court shall rule for confiscation in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of this Decree-Law.

**ANALYSIS:** This new article creates a **lower threshold offense** where:
- No actual knowledge required
- "Sufficient evidence or presumption" of illegality is enough
- Lower penalties than main Article 2 offense
- This may be relevant for borderline cases

---

### Article 22 - Penalties (Updated)

1. Imprisonment up to 10 years + fine AED 100,000 - 5,000,000 or either penalty.

2. Temporary imprisonment + fine AED 300,000 - 10,000,000 for aggravated circumstances.

3. Attempt punishable by full penalty.

4. Life imprisonment or minimum 10 years + fine for terrorist financing.

5. Temporary imprisonment + fine minimum AED 300,000 - 10,000,000 for financing illegal organizations.

6. **[UPDATED]** The Court may at the request of the Attorney General, his delegate, **or on its own initiative** commute or exempt from the sentence if offenders provide information leading to disclosure, prosecution, arrest of perpetrators **or seizure of proceeds.**

---

### Article 23 - Corporate Penalties (Updated)

1. Fine AED 500,000 - 50,000,000 for legal persons.

2. Dissolution for terrorism/illegal organization financing.

3. **[NEW]** Should a legal person be convicted of crimes under Article 2(1) or Article 8, the court **may prevent him from practicing his activity for a specified period, or cancel the license, restriction or registration to practice activity.**

4. Court shall order publication of judgment summary.

---

### Article 26 - Confiscation (Updated)

1. Court shall confiscate:
   a) Funds, proceeds and instrumentalities
   b) Equivalent value if original cannot be confiscated
   
   **[NEW]** If confiscation not possible due to failure to seize or bona fide third party rights, **court shall pass a fine equivalent to its value at the time of the crime.**

2. Confiscation regardless of ownership/possession.

3. **[CLARIFIED]** Unknown offender, lack of criminal responsibility, or statute of limitations **does not preclude** confiscation if proven related to crime.

4. Void contracts aimed at evading seizure/freezing.

---

### Article 29 - Deportation (Updated)

1. **Mandatory deportation** for foreigners convicted of money laundering with freedom-restricting sanction.

2. Discretionary deportation for other offenses.

3. No statute of limitations for ML/TF crimes.

4. Law 7/2014 provisions preserved.

5. **[CLARIFIED]** Financing illegal organizations crime if purpose is to undermine internal security; terrorism financing and Article 28 offenses are crimes against internal **and external** security.

## Comparison: Knowledge Standard

| Law Version | Knowledge Requirement |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **20/2018 (Original)** | "having the knowledge" |
| **26/2021 (Amendment)** | "having the knowledge" (unchanged) |
| **10/2025 (Current)** | "knows, or has sufficient evidence or circumstantial evidence to support his knowledge" |

**For Case 227/2024 (offense date 20.09.2024):**
- The 20/2018 + 26/2021 version applies
- Requires **actual knowledge** that funds are proceeds of crime
- "Sufficient evidence or presumption" standard only applies to new Article 25 bis (lesser offense)

## Defense Implications for Case 227/2024

### Favorable Points Under This Law:

1. **Knowledge Requirement:** Prosecution must prove accused **actually knew** funds were proceeds of crime, not merely that there was "sufficient evidence" of illegality.

2. **Predicate Offense:** While Article 2(3) says proving illicit source isn't prerequisite, jurisprudence requires establishing a predicate offense occurred.

3. **Intent:** Both general and special intent must be proven.

4. **Article 25 bis Alternative:** If prosecution cannot prove actual knowledge under Article 2, they might charge under 25 bis - but:
   - Lower penalty (3+ months vs 10 years max)
   - Still requires "sufficient evidence or presumption" which defense challenges

### Key Defense Arguments:

1. **Legitimate Source:** Documented sale of companies (1,850,000 EUR) negates predicate offense.

2. **No Concealment Intent:** Transparent banking through licensed institutions.

3. **Bank Approval:** Both Mashreq and FAB approved transfers without objection.

4. **No Predicate Crime:** No evidence of any underlying criminal activity generating the funds.

5. **FIU Report Deficiencies:** Report based on assumptions, not verified facts about fund origins.
