   - No material mistake or misrepresentation

2. **Damages:** Compensation for losses directly caused by the breach

A commercial agent is appointed to represent a principal in commercial transactions. Requirements include:

1. Written agency agreement
2. Registration with Ministry of Economy (for commercial agencies)
3. Clear scope of authority

## Application in Practice

### Contract Disputes

UAE courts interpret contracts according to:
1. Literal meaning of clear terms
2. Intention of parties where ambiguous
3. Custom and practice in relevant industry
4. Good faith and equity

### Conflict with Shariah

Where civil law conflicts with Islamic Shariah principles, Shariah generally prevails, particularly in matters of:
- Family law
- Inheritance
- Islamic finance transactions

## International Considerations

### DIFC and ADGM

Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) operate under separate legal frameworks based on English common law, not this Civil Transactions Law.

**Applicability:** This law does not apply within DIFC or ADGM free zones unless specifically incorporated.

## Conclusion

The Civil Transactions Law remains the cornerstone of UAE civil and commercial law. It provides a comprehensive framework that balances Islamic principles with modern commercial needs, supporting the UAE's position as a major business hub.
