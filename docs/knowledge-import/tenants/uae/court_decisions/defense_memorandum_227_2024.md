## Defense Arguments

### FIRST DEFENSE: Non-existence of Money Laundering Crime

**Legal Basis - Dubai Cassation Court Jurisprudence:**

Per Article 2 of Federal Decree-Law No. 20 of 2018:
> "Money laundering crime requires for its completion that funds originate from a felony or misdemeanor with knowledge thereof, and that the laundering perpetrator commits one of the acts mentioned therein..."

**Key Legal Principle:**
> "There is no room to discuss money laundering crime unless there are funds originating from an illegal source."

*Reference: Dubai Cassation Court Judgment dated 26-06-2024 in Appeal No. 2023/1476 Criminal*

**Defense Points:**

1. Documents (2, 3) prove that on 23.08.2019, first accused sold 100% shares in two companies for total 1,850,000 EUR

2. All sale and transfer contracts are duly authenticated by all competent authorities

3. In 2019, first accused made bank transfer of 1,800,000 EUR through Fio Bank Slovakia to Mashreq Bank UAE after fulfilling all transfer requirements

4. Financial Intelligence Unit report (prosecution's own evidence) confirms source of funds was transfer from accused's company Agrofruktus s.r.o. in Slovakia - value 7 million AED

5. No credible document or evidence in case files proving funds originated from any criminal offense

6. 4 farms and large number of livestock were part of assets of both sold companies

7. No evidence that accused took any actions to conceal or disguise funds

8. No evidence that funds (1,800,000 EUR) originate from criminal offense domestically or abroad

**Legal Principle:**
> "Criminal judgments are based on certainty and conviction, not on doubts, conjectures and assumptions."

---

### SECOND DEFENSE: Elements of Crime Not Fulfilled

**Legal Basis - Dubai Cassation Court:**
> "Intent in money laundering crime requires perpetrator's knowledge at time of committing offense with certainty of fulfillment of its elements including intent, and if accused disputes fulfillment of this intent, court must sufficiently prove it."

*Reference: Dubai Cassation Court Judgment dated 26-06-2024 in Appeal No. 2023/1476 Criminal*

**Special Intent Requirement:**
Money laundering requires beyond general intent a **special intent** - intention to conceal funds or disguise their nature, source, location, or entitled person.

*Reference: Dubai Cassation Court Judgment dated 17-05-2021 in Appeal No. 2021/385 Criminal*

**Defense Points:**

a. First accused denied offense from beginning of investigation

b. First accused consistently maintained legitimacy of source of funds

c. All legally authenticated documents were submitted proving lawful source

d. Accused used bank accounts transparently for over 5 years (2019-2024)

e. No transfers to any country other than Slovakia (first accused's home country)

f. If any suspicion existed, First Abu Dhabi Bank would not have approved international transfers

g. International bank transfers to home country cannot constitute intent to conceal

---

### THIRD DEFENSE: Incorrect Legal Classification by Prosecution

**Legal Basis - Dubai Cassation Court:**
> "Article 216 of Criminal Procedure Code requires every conviction judgment to state the act requiring punishment so that elements of crime are fulfilled... otherwise judgment would be defective."

*Reference: Dubai Cassation Court Judgment dated 11-05-2020 in Appeal No. 2020/238 Criminal*

**Defense Points:**

a. Prosecution did not identify predicate offense

b. Prosecution did not explain reasons, indicators proving accused's knowledge of illegal origin

c. Financial Intelligence Unit report (prosecution's evidence) only examined transactions and transfers without verifying legitimacy of fund source

d. Definition of suspicious transactions under Article 1 of Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2021 requires "reasonable grounds to suspect" funds originate from criminal offense

e. No evidence accused has any connection to terrorist or illegal organizations

---

### FOURTH DEFENSE: Invalidity of Financial Intelligence Unit Report

**Legal Principle:**
> "In criminal matters, it is sufficient for judge to doubt correctness of attribution of charge to rule for acquittal."

**First Aspect - No Criminal Record:**
- Documents prove first accused has no criminal record
- Interpol inquiry confirmed no criminal record abroad
- International criminal record check shows no matters related to money laundering or terrorism financing
- Only one civil matter regarding economic competition and copyright (unrelated to money laundering)

**Second Aspect - 141 Financial Institutions Queried:**
- Financial Intelligence Unit queried 141+ financial institutions (banks, exchanges)
- Confirmed first accused owns no bank or forex accounts personally in UAE
- Company (second accused) owns accounts only at Mashreq Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank
- This proves no concealment attempts

**Third Aspect - Report Based on Assumptions:**

The report states:
> "We assume the suspect established company in country for purpose of laundering funds coming from Slovakia through his accounts."

**This assumption contradicts documented evidence of legitimate fund source.**

**Rebuttal of Report's Suspicion Grounds:**

1. **"Suspicious transaction reports exist"** - Vague, unclear, no evidence. STR from First Abu Dhabi Bank contains no precise explanation of nature, dates, values of suspicious transactions.

2. **"Zurich International Life Limited connection"** - This is a global insurance company with UAE branch. First accused had life insurance policy and made regular premium payments. **Attachment 4:** Email correspondence and account statement proving insurance relationship.

3. **"Financial activity does not match expectations"** - First accused confirmed at prosecution investigation that he used legitimate funds for personal purposes and transferred portion to Slovakia for agricultural business.

4. **"Secondary fund movement on company accounts"** - Report contradicts itself: claims secondary movement while also claiming high and excessive turnover.

5. **"No documents provided"** - False. Neither Mashreq Bank nor First Abu Dhabi Bank ever contacted accused for additional information or supporting documents.

---

### FIFTH DEFENSE: Invalidity of Police Station Interrogation

**Legal Basis - Dubai Cassation Court:**
> "Per Article 40 of Criminal Procedure Code, judicial police officer is authorized to ask accused about charge attributed to him without detailed interrogation... Detailed interrogation prohibited by law for judicial police officer, to be conducted by prosecution if deemed necessary, is per Article 68 of Criminal Procedure Code confronting accused with various evidence against him and interrogating him in detail."

*Reference: Dubai Cassation Court Judgment dated 19-11-2005 in Appeal No. 395/2005 Criminal*

**Prohibited Interrogation Questions Asked by Police:**
- What is nature of your work?
- How did you establish license in Umm Al Quwain?
- Do you have any property in the state?
- Do you have companies domestically or abroad?
- What is nature of Andros Business Consulting's activity?
- What is reason for renewing company license every year?
- What are your sources of income?
- What is origin of 1,800,000 EUR you transferred?
- Do you have any documents proving this?
- What did you do with 1,800,000 EUR?
- Where did you buy farms and for how much?
- Why did you transfer 1,800,000 EUR to Mashreq Bank account?

**Principle:** "What is built on invalid is itself invalid"

---

### SIXTH DEFENSE: Invalidity Due to Unlicensed Interpreter

**Legal Basis - Dubai Cassation Court:**
> "Per Article 8 of Decree-Law No. 38 of 2022 issuing Criminal Procedure Code, if foreigner or other person not proficient in Arabic was heard in evidence gathering record or prosecution investigation or before court - and court decision bases its conclusions thereon - without appointing designated or licensed or sworn interpreter or approved technical means by competent authority and his statement was recorded, this act is tainted with invalidity that transfers to judgment relying on it."

*Reference: Dubai Cassation Court Judgment dated 15-09-2025 in Appeal No. 635/2025 Criminal*

**Facts:**
- Detention record shows judicial police officers appointed interpreter who is not sworn, not accredited, not licensed
- Interpreter (Mariam Adel Hamid) did not sign detention record to avoid legal responsibility
- Courts in both instances appointed accredited interpreter when hearing accused

---

### SEVENTH DEFENSE: Deficiencies in Prosecution Investigation

1. Prosecution referred accused to court without establishing prosecution evidence despite proving legitimacy of fund source

2. Prosecution referred accused despite absence of any evidence of predicate offense

3. **02.07.2025:** Prosecution sent legal assistance request to Slovak Republic judicial authorities (only 3 months before referral order)
   - Purpose: Track all bank accounts of first accused and recipients of bank transfers
   - Provide list of companies and commercial licenses
   - **Prosecution issued referral order before receiving response to legal assistance request**

---

## Conclusion

Examination of accused's statements throughout all stages (evidence gathering, prosecution investigation, trial) clearly shows:
- Truthfulness of accused's statements
- Accused did not commit crime attributed to him
- Case documents including Financial Intelligence Unit report (prosecution's own evidence) confirmed legitimacy of fund source

The accused has never been involved in money laundering crimes. This type of crime does not reflect true nature and behavior of accused.
