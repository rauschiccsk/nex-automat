**Appellant:** Dubai Construction Company LLC (Contractor)  
**Respondent:** Emirates Real Estate Development PJSC (Developer)  
**Subject Matter:** Construction contract dispute - Force majeure claim  
**Amount in Dispute:** AED 45,000,000

## Background

### Original Contract (2021)

Dubai Construction Company LLC ("the Contractor") entered into a construction contract with Emirates Real Estate Development PJSC ("the Developer") on January 15, 2021, for the construction of a residential tower in Dubai Marina.

**Contract Terms:**
- Contract value: AED 180,000,000
- Duration: 24 months (completion by January 15, 2023)
- Payment terms: Monthly progress payments
- Penalty clause: AED 50,000 per day for late completion

### Events Leading to Dispute

1. **March 2022:** Global supply chain disruptions caused delays in steel delivery
2. **June 2022:** Contractor notified Developer of 3-month delay
3. **September 2022:** Further delays due to specialized equipment unavailability
4. **January 2023:** Project incomplete; Developer imposed liquidated damages
5. **March 2023:** Final completion; total delay: 90 days

**Developer's Position:** Contractor liable for AED 4,500,000 in liquidated damages (90 days × AED 50,000)

**Contractor's Position:** Delays caused by force majeure; entitled to time extension without penalties

## Lower Court Proceedings

### Court of First Instance (March 2023)

**Ruling:** Dismissed Contractor's force majeure claim  
**Reasoning:**
- Supply chain issues were foreseeable in 2022
- Contractor failed to demonstrate impossibility of performance
- No evidence of reasonable mitigation efforts

**Damages Awarded:** AED 4,500,000 plus legal costs

### Court of Appeal (August 2023)

**Ruling:** Upheld First Instance decision  
**Additional Finding:** Contractor's notice of delay was insufficient and not timely

## Federal Supreme Court Appeal

### Grounds of Appeal

The Contractor appealed on three grounds:

1. **Error in Law:** Courts misapplied Article 272 of Civil Transactions Law regarding force majeure
2. **Error in Fact:** Ignored evidence of global steel shortage beyond Contractor's control
3. **Procedural Error:** Failed to consider expert testimony on industry standards

### Arguments

#### Appellant's Arguments

**1. Global Pandemic Context:**
- COVID-19 created unprecedented supply chain disruptions
- Steel prices increased 300% globally
- Shipping delays affected entire construction industry

**2. Impossibility of Performance:**
- Specialized steel grades unavailable in UAE market
- International suppliers unable to guarantee delivery dates
- Alternative suppliers quoted 12-month lead times

**3. Good Faith Efforts:**
- Contractor sought alternative suppliers in 15 countries
- Expedited shipping options explored
- Regular communication with Developer maintained

**4. Industry Practice:**
- Similar projects experienced comparable delays
- Dubai Municipality granted time extensions to other projects
- Developer benefited from market appreciation during delay

#### Respondent's Arguments

**1. Foreseeability:**
- Supply disruptions were known by June 2021
- Contractor should have secured materials earlier
- Force majeure clause specifically excluded foreseeable events

**2. Contractual Allocation of Risk:**
- Contract placed supply risk on Contractor
- No force majeure provision for market conditions
- Liquidated damages clause was freely negotiated

**3. Failure to Mitigate:**
- Contractor did not explore all available suppliers
- Alternative construction methods not considered
- Delay notice sent 4 months after initial disruption

## Court's Analysis

### Legal Framework

The Court examined Article 272 of Federal Law No. 5 of 1985 (Civil Transactions Law):

> "A party is excused from performance if prevented by force majeure... force majeure means an unforeseeable event beyond the party's control."

**Three Elements Required:**
1. Unforeseability at contract formation
2. Impossibility (not mere difficulty) of performance
3. Event beyond party's control

### Application to Facts

#### 1. Unforeseability Analysis

**Court's Finding:** Partially foreseeable

**Reasoning:**
- Contract signed January 2021, after COVID-19 onset
- Supply disruptions already occurring in late 2020
- However, **scale and duration** of 2022 disruptions exceeded reasonable expectations
- Contractor could not foresee complete unavailability of specialized steel

**Precedent Cited:** Abu Dhabi Court of Cassation Case No. 456/2022 (pandemic impacts)

#### 2. Impossibility vs. Difficulty

**Court's Finding:** Impossibility established for 60-day period

**Reasoning:**
- Evidence showed **zero suppliers** could deliver required steel grades March-May 2022
- This constitutes impossibility, not mere increased cost or difficulty
- Contractor's evidence from 15 international suppliers supported this
- Expert testimony confirmed industry-wide shortage

**Distinction:** June-September 2022 period showed difficulty, not impossibility

#### 3. Control and Mitigation

**Court's Finding:** Event beyond Contractor's control, but mitigation efforts inadequate

**Reasoning:**
- Global steel shortage clearly beyond Contractor's control
- However, Contractor should have:
  - Ordered long-lead items earlier
  - Explored alternative construction methods
  - Redesigned non-critical elements to use available materials

## Supreme Court Decision

### Ruling

**PARTIALLY ALLOWED**

The Court:

1. **Set aside** liquidated damages for period March 1 - April 30, 2022 (60 days)
2. **Upheld** liquidated damages for remaining 30 days
3. **Reduced** total damages from AED 4,500,000 to AED 1,500,000

### Reasoning

**Force Majeure Period (60 days):**
- March-April 2022: Complete impossibility established
- No suppliers worldwide could deliver
- Contractor excused from performance under Article 272

**Non-Force Majeure Period (30 days):**
- June-September 2022: Difficulty, not impossibility
- Alternative solutions available but not pursued
- Contractor bore risk of these delays

### Legal Principles Established

#### 1. Partial Force Majeure

**New Principle:** Force majeure can apply to **part** of a delay period

**Court's Statement:**
> "Force majeure relief need not be all-or-nothing. Courts must examine each time period separately and apply the law to the facts of that period."

**Impact:** This refines UAE contract law by recognizing graduated force majeure relief.

#### 2. Foreseeability in Pandemic Context

**Clarification:** General awareness of pandemic does not make all disruptions foreseeable

**Court's Statement:**
> "While parties in 2021 knew of COVID-19, they could not foresee the specific supply chain collapse of early 2022. Foreseeability requires specificity, not general awareness of risk."

#### 3. Mitigation Duty

**Reaffirmed:** Party claiming force majeure must still mitigate

**Court's Statement:**
> "Even where force majeure excuses performance, the affected party must take all reasonable steps to minimize delay and communicate promptly."

## Orders

1. **Judgment varied:** Damages reduced to AED 1,500,000
2. **Costs:** Developer to pay 60% of Contractor's appeal costs
3. **Interest:** Legal interest on reduced amount from date of First Instance judgment
4. **Final:** This judgment is final and not subject to further appeal

## Dissenting Opinion

Justice Fatima Al Hashimi **partially dissented**:

**Position:** Would have excused all delays

**Reasoning:**
- Construction industry operates on tight margins
- Contractor acted in good faith throughout
- Retrospective analysis of mitigation is unfair
- Developer suffered no actual loss (property value increased)

**Response from Majority:**
> "Sympathy for Contractor's position does not override contractual allocation of risk. Good faith does not eliminate duty to mitigate."

## Implications

### For Construction Industry

1. **Force Majeure Clauses:** Should specifically address pandemic-related events
2. **Early Procurement:** Critical to order long-lead items early
3. **Communication:** Prompt and detailed notice essential
4. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive records of mitigation efforts

### For Contract Drafting

1. **Define Force Majeure:** Be specific about covered events
2. **Allocation of Risk:** Clearly state who bears supply chain risk
3. **Mitigation Requirements:** Spell out expected mitigation steps
4. **Notice Provisions:** Specify timing and content of force majeure notices

### For Future Cases

This decision provides guidance on:
- Partial application of force majeure
- Foreseeability in extraordinary circumstances
- Balance between impossibility and mitigation
- Evidence required to establish force majeure

## Related Cases

- Abu Dhabi Court of Cassation No. 456/2022 (pandemic force majeure)
- Dubai Court of Cassation No. 789/2021 (construction delays)
- Federal Supreme Court No. 234/2020 (liquidated damages enforceability)

## Commentary

This landmark decision demonstrates the UAE courts' sophisticated approach to modern commercial disputes. The Court balanced:

- **Legal principles** (strict contract interpretation)
- **Practical realities** (unprecedented global events)
- **Equitable considerations** (fairness to both parties)

The partial force majeure approach is particularly noteworthy, allowing courts to apportion responsibility fairly rather than adopting an all-or-nothing stance.
