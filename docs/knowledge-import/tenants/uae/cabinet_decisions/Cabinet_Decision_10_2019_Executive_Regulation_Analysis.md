## 🔍 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Cabinet Decision No. 10 of 2019 serves as the comprehensive implementing regulation for Federal Decree-Law No. 20/2018 on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Illegal Organisations. This 62-article regulation establishes detailed operational requirements for financial institutions, Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), and Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) in combating financial crime.

The regulation introduces a **risk-based approach** to AML/CFT compliance, requiring institutions to identify, assess, and mitigate money laundering risks commensurate with their business nature and size. Key compliance pillars include Customer Due Diligence (CDD) measures, Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR), record-keeping requirements, and internal compliance programs.

For money laundering defense cases, this regulation is critical because it defines:
- **Evidentiary standards** for what constitutes "reasonable grounds to suspect" in STR filings
- **CDD thresholds** (AED 55,000 for cash transactions, AED 3,500 for wire transfers)
- **Freezing powers** of the Financial Intelligence Unit (7-day administrative freeze)
- **Compliance obligations** that form the basis of institutional reporting decisions
- **Procedural safeguards** available to accused persons

The regulation was superseded by Cabinet Decision No. 134/2025 following the enactment of Federal Decree-Law No. 10/2025, but remains the controlling legal framework for cases initiated before 14 October 2025.

## CHAPTER 1: DEFINITIONS (Article 1)

### Critical Definitions for Money Laundering Cases

#### Money Laundering
**Definition:** Any of the acts mentioned in Clause (1) of Article (2) of Federal Decree-Law No. 20/2018.

**Case Relevance:** The regulation incorporates by reference the parent law's definition. Defense must examine whether charged conduct actually falls within statutory definition.

#### Suspicious Transactions
**Definition:** "Transactions related to funds for which there are **reasonable grounds to suspect** that they are earned from any felony or misdemeanour related to the financing of terrorism or of illegal organisations, whether committed or attempted."

**🎯 Defense Strategy:**
- The **"reasonable grounds to suspect"** standard is subjective and fact-dependent
- Challenge whether reporting institution had objective, articulable facts
- Distinguish from "probable cause" or "beyond reasonable doubt" standards
- Examine whether suspicion was based on speculation vs. concrete indicators

#### Predicate Offence
**Definition:** "Any act constituting a felony or misdemeanour under the applicable laws of the State whether this act is committed inside or outside the State when such act is punishable in both countries."

**Case Relevance:** 
- **Dual criminality requirement** for foreign predicate offenses
- Defense can challenge whether alleged predicate offense is criminal in both jurisdictions
- No requirement that predicate offense result in conviction

#### Beneficial Owner
**Definition:** "The natural person who ultimately owns or exercises effective control, directly or indirectly, over a Customer or the natural person on whose behalf a Transaction is being conducted or, the natural person who exercises effective ultimate control over a legal person or Legal Arrangement."

**Key Thresholds:**
- **25% or more** controlling ownership interest in legal persons (Article 9)
- Must trace through layers to natural person

**Defense Strategy:**
- Challenge institution's identification of beneficial owner
- Question adequacy of beneficial owner verification
- Complex corporate structures may obscure true beneficial ownership

#### High Risk Customer
**Definition:** Comprehensive definition including:
- Customers from high-risk countries
- Non-residents without local identity card
- Complex corporate structures
- Unclear economic objectives
- **Cash-intensive operations**
- Operations with unknown third parties
- Operations without direct face-to-face meetings

**🎯 Defense Strategy:**
- "High risk" designation triggers Enhanced CDD, not criminal liability
- Challenge whether institution properly applied risk assessment methodology
- Question whether risk factors were objectively present or assumed

#### Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
**Definition:** Natural persons entrusted with prominent public functions in UAE or foreign countries, including:
- Heads of States or Governments
- Senior politicians
- Senior government officials
- Judicial or military officials
- Senior executives of state-owned corporations
- Senior officials of political parties
- International organisation officials

**Extended to:**
- **Direct family members** (spouses, children, spouses of children, parents)
- **Known close associates** (joint ownership, close business relationships, individual ownership in entities established for PEP)

**Defense Strategy:**
- PEP status alone is not evidence of criminality
- Enhanced CDD is preventive measure, not accusation
- Challenge whether person actually qualified as PEP under definition
- Question whether "close associate" designation was properly established

#### Freezing or Seizure
**Definition:** "Temporary restriction over the moving, conversion, transfer, replacement or disposition of funds in any form, by an order issued by a Competent Authority."

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Freezing:** FIU power under Article 46 (7-day administrative freeze)
- **Seizure:** Public Prosecution/Court power under Article 47 (judicial freeze)

#### Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
**Definition:** "Process of identifying or verifying the information of a Customer or Beneficial Owner, whether a natural or legal person or a legal arrangement, and the nature of its activity and the purpose of the business relationship and the ownership structure and control over it for the purposes of the Decretal-Law and this Decision."

**Components:**
1. Identity verification (natural and legal persons)
2. Beneficial owner identification
3. Purpose and nature of business relationship
4. Ownership and control structure understanding
5. Ongoing monitoring

## CHAPTER 2: FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DNFBPs, AND NON-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS

### PART 1: FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DNFBPs

#### Section 1: Activities and Transactions (Articles 2-3)

**Article 2: Financial Activities and Transactions**

Defines 17 categories of financial activities, including:

16. Any other activity determined by Supervisory Authority

**🎯 Case Relevance:** Determines which entities are subject to AML/CFT obligations. Defense can challenge whether accused institution actually conducted "financial activities" under this definition.

**Article 3: Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs)**

Covered entities:
1. **Real estate brokers and agents** (purchase/sale transactions)
2. **Dealers in precious metals/stones** (cash transactions ≥ AED 55,000)
3. **Lawyers, notaries, independent legal professionals, accountants** when:
   - Purchasing/selling real estate

- Assessment of customer's legal position
- Defending/representing before judiciary/arbitration
- Providing legal opinions on legal proceedings
- Information obtained subject to professional secrecy

**🎯 Defense Strategy:**
- Challenge whether accused was acting as DNFBP or in exempt legal advisory capacity
- Professional legal privilege may shield certain communications from STR requirements

#### Section 2: Identification and Mitigation of Risks (Article 4)

**Article 4: Risk-Based Approach**

**Requirements:**

**Clause 1: Risk Assessment Obligations**
Financial institutions and DNFBPs must:
- **Identify, assess, and understand** crime risks
- Consider business nature and size
- Evaluate risk factors:
  - Customers (identity, behavior, profile)
  - Countries/geographic areas (high-risk jurisdictions)
  - Products, services, transactions (complexity, anonymity)
  - Delivery channels (face-to-face vs. remote)
- **Document risk assessments**
- Keep assessments **up-to-date on ongoing basis**
- Make available upon request to Supervisory Authority

**Clause 2: Risk Mitigation Measures**
- Develop internal policies, controls, procedures
- Policies must be **approved by senior management**
- Must be commensurate with nature and size of business
- Monitor implementation
- Enhance as necessary
- Consider National Risk Assessment results

**Enhanced CDD for High Risks (Article 4(2)(b)):**
1. Obtain more information, investigate further
2. Update CDD information more systematically
3. **Take reasonable measures to identify source of funds**
4. Increase degree/level of ongoing monitoring
5. **Obtain senior management approval** to commence business relationship

**Clause 3: Simplified CDD for Low Risks**
Permitted when requirements of Clauses 1-2 are met, unless suspicion exists:
- Verify identity **after** establishing business relationship
- Update customer data less frequently
- Reduce rate of ongoing monitoring
- Conclude purpose/nature based on transaction type without specific procedures

**🎯 Case Relevance - Defense Strategies:**

1. **Challenge Risk Assessment Methodology:**
   - Request institution's documented risk assessment
   - Question whether risk factors were objectively applied
   - Examine whether assessment was updated as required

2. **Question Enhanced CDD Triggers:**
   - Were Enhanced CDD measures actually required?
   - Did institution properly identify "source of funds"?
   - Was senior management approval obtained?

3. **Simplified CDD Misapplication:**
   - Did institution improperly apply Simplified CDD to high-risk customer?
   - Was there underlying suspicion that precluded Simplified CDD?

4. **Documentation Failures:**
   - Demand production of risk assessment documents
   - Absence of documented assessment = non-compliance by institution
   - Undermines credibility of STR if risk assessment was inadequate

5. **National Risk Assessment Alignment:**
   - Did institution consider National Risk Assessment?
   - Were institutional policies consistent with national priorities?

**Key Defense Arguments:**
- **Subjective nature of risk assessment:** "High risk" is judgment call, not objective fact
- **Lack of documentation:** Institution's failure to document may indicate haphazard approach
- **Inconsistent application:** If institution applied different standards to similar customers, demonstrates arbitrary enforcement
- **Retrospective risk reclassification:** Institution may have elevated risk after transaction, not before

---

#### Section 3: Customer Due Diligence (CDD) (Articles 5-14)

**Article 5: Timing of CDD Measures**

**General Rule (Clause 1):**
Financial institutions and DNFBPs must undertake CDD measures to verify identity of Customer and Beneficial Owner:
- **Before** or **during** establishment of business relationship
- **Before** opening an account
- **Before** executing transaction for customer with no business relationship

**Exception - Delayed Verification:**
When **low crime risk** exists, verification may be completed **after** establishment of business relationship, IF:
1. Verification conducted **in timely manner** from commencement
2. Delay necessary to not obstruct natural course of business
3. **Appropriate and effective risk control measures** implemented

**Clause 2:** Institutions must manage risks where customers benefit from relationship before verification complete.

**🎯 Case Relevance:**
- **Defense can challenge timing:** Was CDD actually performed before or during relationship?
- **Post-establishment verification:** If verification delayed, did institution implement required risk controls?
- **"Natural course of business" justification:** Was delay actually necessary, or was it institutional laxity?

---

**Article 6: When CDD Measures Required**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must undertake CDD in following cases:

1. **Establishing business relationship**
2. **Occasional transactions ≥ AED 55,000**
   - Single transaction OR
   - Several transactions that **appear to be linked**
3. **Wire Transfers ≥ AED 3,500**
4. **Suspicion of Crime exists**
5. **Doubts about veracity/adequacy** of previously obtained customer identification data

**🎯 Critical Thresholds for Defense:**

**AED 55,000 Threshold (Clause 2):**
- Applies to occasional transactions (no ongoing relationship)
- Includes "several transactions that appear to be linked"
  - **Structuring defense:** Were transactions actually linked, or coincidentally near threshold?
  - **Burden of proof:** Who must prove transactions "appear to be linked"?
  
**AED 3,500 Threshold for Wire Transfers (Clause 3):**
- Lower threshold reflects international wire transfer risks
- Applies to single wire transfer ≥ AED 3,500

**"Suspicion of Crime" Trigger (Clause 4):**
- CDD required even for transactions below monetary thresholds
- **Circular logic risk:** Suspicion triggers CDD, but lack of CDD may create suspicion

**Doubts About Existing Data (Clause 5):**
- Institution must re-verify if doubts arise
- **Defense argument:** Were "doubts" objectively reasonable, or pretextual?

---

**Article 7: Ongoing CDD and Monitoring**

**Requirements:**

**Clause 1: Transaction Auditing**
- Audit transactions throughout business relationship
- Ensure transactions **consistent with:**
  - Information about customer
  - Customer's type of activity
  - Risks customer poses
- **Where necessary:** Verify source of funds

**Clause 2: Record Updates**
- Ensure documents, data, information are **up-to-date and appropriate**
- Review records, **particularly for high-risk customers**

**🎯 Case Relevance:**

**"Consistency" Analysis:**
- Defense can challenge whether transactions were actually inconsistent with customer profile
- **Retroactive risk assessment:** Did institution create adverse profile after STR filing?

**"Source of Funds" Investigation:**
- Required only "where necessary"
- **Defense questions:**
  - What made source of funds investigation necessary?
  - Did institution actually conduct this investigation?
  - If conducted, what evidence did they find/ignore?

**High-Risk Customer Scrutiny:**
- Enhanced monitoring required
- **Defense strategy:** If client was high-risk, institution should have conducted more thorough due diligence upfront
- Failure to properly monitor high-risk customer may undermine STR credibility

---

**Article 8: Customer Identification Requirements**

**Clause 1(a): Natural Persons**

Required information:
- Name (as in ID card or travel document)
- Nationality
- Address
- Place of birth
- Name and address of employer

**Clause 2:** Verify authority of persons acting on behalf of customer

**Clause 3:** Understand **intended purpose and nature** of business relationship

**Clause 4:** Understand:
- Nature of customer's business
- Customer's **ownership and control structure**

**🎯 Defense Strategies:**

**Identification Deficiencies:**
- Did institution actually collect all required information?
- Were copies of ID documents obtained and verified?
- **Missing information = incomplete CDD = questionable STR basis**

**PEP Approval Requirement:**
- If customer was PEP, was senior management approval obtained?
- **Lack of approval = violation by institution**

**Purpose of Business Relationship:**
- Did institution actually understand purpose?
- Was purpose inquiry meaningful or pro forma checkbox?
- **Vague or generic "purpose" description suggests inadequate CDD**

**Ownership Structure:**
- For legal entities, did institution truly understand control structure?
- Were shell companies or complex structures properly investigated?

**Authentication of Documents:**
- Were ID documents verified against forgery?
- Did institution use "reliable and independent source" as required?

---

**Article 9: Beneficial Owner Identification**

**"Reasonable measures" required to identify and verify Beneficial Owners**

**Clause 1: For Legal Persons**

**Primary Method (1(a)):**
- Identify natural person(s) with **controlling ownership interest of 25% or more**
- Can be held individually or jointly with another person
- If fail or have doubt → verify by other means

**Secondary Method (1(b)):**
- If cannot identify controlling ownership interest, OR
- Person with controlling ownership is not Beneficial Owner
- Then identify natural person(s) holding **senior management officer position**

**Clause 2: For Legal Arrangements (Trusts)**

Verify identity of:
- **Settlor** (person who created trust)
- **Trustee(s)** (person managing trust assets)
- **Beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries**
- Any other natural person exercising **ultimate effective control**
- Obtain sufficient information to verify beneficiary identity:
  - At time of payment, OR
  - At time of exercising legally acquired rights

**🎯 Critical Defense Analysis:**

**25% Threshold Issues:**
- Bright-line rule for ownership
- **Defense questions:**
  - Was ownership properly calculated?
  - Were indirect holdings traced through multiple layers?
  - Did institution verify ownership or rely on representations?

**"Reasonable Measures" Standard:**
- Not defined - fact-dependent inquiry
- **What is "reasonable"?**
  - Public registry searches?
  - Corporate documents?
  - Customer declarations?
  - Third-party due diligence reports?

**Failure to Identify:**
- If institution couldn't identify Beneficial Owner, what did they do?
- Did they terminate relationship (as required by Article 13)?
- **Or did they proceed despite non-compliance?**

**Complex Structure Defense:**
- Multi-layered corporate structures may legitimately obscure beneficial ownership
- **Burden should be on institution to demonstrate thorough investigation**

**Trust Arrangement Challenges:**
- Beneficiaries may not be determinable at time of CDD
- "Class of beneficiaries" (e.g., "future grandchildren") creates uncertainty
- Did institution obtain "sufficient information" as required?

---

**Article 10: Exemptions from Beneficial Owner Identification**

**Financial institutions and DNFBPs exempted from identifying shareholders, partners, or Beneficial Owners IF information is obtainable from reliable sources AND customer or controlling interest holder is:**

**Clause 1: Listed Companies**
- Company listed on **regulated stock exchange**
- Subject to **disclosure requirements** ensuring adequate transparency for Beneficial Owner

**Clause 2: Subsidiaries**
- Majority shares/stocks held by shareholders of holding company
- (Beneficial ownership traceable through parent company)

**🎯 Defense Application:**
- If customer was listed company or subsidiary, CDD requirements reduced
- **Challenge:** Did institution properly verify listing/subsidiary status?
- **Public company defense:** Trading on regulated exchange provides transparency

---

**Article 11: Life Insurance Beneficiaries - Special CDD**

**Clause 1: Beneficiary CDD Requirements**

Financial institutions must conduct CDD and ongoing monitoring of beneficiaries of:
- Life insurance policies
- Funds generating transactions
- Life insurance products relating to investments
- Family Takaful insurance

**Timing:** As soon as beneficiary is identified or designated

**Methods:**

**(a) Beneficiary Identified by Name:**
- Obtain name of person (natural person, legal person, or legal arrangement)

**(b) Beneficiary Designated by Characteristics/Class:**
- Examples: Family relation (parent, child), will, estate
- Obtain **sufficient information** to establish identity at time of pay-out

**Clause 2: High-Risk Beneficiaries**
- Verify identity at:
  - Time of pay-out, OR
  - Prior to exercising policy rights
- If beneficiary is **high-risk legal person or arrangement:**
  - Conduct **Enhanced CDD** to identify Beneficial Owner

**🎯 Case Relevance:**
- Generally less relevant to money laundering prosecutions
- May be relevant if insurance products used to layer illicit funds
- **Defense:** Challenge whether institution conducted required beneficiary CDD

---

**Article 12: CDD for Existing Customers**

**Retroactive Application:**
Financial institutions and DNFBPs must apply CDD measures to:
- **Existing customers** as of effective date (10 February 2019)
- **Ongoing business relationships** as of effective date

**Timing:** Within times deemed appropriate based on:
- Relative importance
- **Risk priority**

**Verification:** Ensure sufficiency of data acquired if CDD applied before effective date

**🎯 Defense Strategy:**
- For relationships established before 2019, was CDD properly updated?
- **Risk-based prioritization:** High-risk customers should have been re-verified first
- If institution delayed CDD updates, questions compliance quality

---

**Article 13: Prohibition on Relationships Without CDD**

**Clause 1: Mandatory Prohibition**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs **PROHIBITED** from:
- Establishing business relationship, OR
- Maintaining business relationship, OR
- Executing any transaction

**IF:** Unable to undertake CDD measures toward customer

**Mandatory Action:** Consider reporting **Suspicious Transaction to FIU**

**Clause 2: Exception - "Tipping Off" Concern**

**EVEN IF** institution suspects commission of Crime, they **should not** apply CDD measures IF:
- Reasonable grounds to believe CDD would **"tip-off"** customer

**Mandatory Action:** 
- Report **Suspicious Transaction to FIU**
- Include reasons preventing CDD measures

**🎯 Critical Defense Analysis:**

**Prohibition as Double-Edged Sword:**
- Institution **required** to terminate relationship if cannot complete CDD
- **Defense question:** If relationship continued, did institution actually complete CDD?
- **If no termination → implies CDD was completed → STR may be based on post-CDD reassessment**

**"Tipping Off" Exception:**
- Allows institution to file STR without conducting CDD
- **Defense challenges:**
  - What were "reasonable grounds to believe" tip-off risk?
  - Was this determination documented?
  - **Or was "tipping off" excuse used to avoid doing proper CDD?**

**STR Without CDD:**
- How can institution form "reasonable grounds to suspect" without conducting due diligence?
- **Catch-22:** Suspicion without investigation may be speculative

**Mandatory STR Consideration:**
- Inability to complete CDD triggers mandatory consideration of STR
- **Does NOT mandate STR filing**
- **Defense:** Did institution automatically equate CDD difficulty with suspicion?

---

**Article 14: Prohibited Relationships and Accounts**

**Clause 1: Shell Bank Prohibition**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must NOT:
- Deal in any way with **Shell Banks**
- Open bank accounts in their names
- Accept funds or deposits from them

**Definition of Shell Bank (Article 1):**
"Bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and is unaffiliated with a regulated financial group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision."

**Clause 2: Pseudonymous/Fictitious Account Prohibition**

Must NOT:
- Create bank accounts using **pseudonyms**
- Create bank accounts using **fictitious names**
- Keep **numbered accounts without account holder's name**

**🎯 Defense Application:**
- Generally not directly relevant to ML prosecutions
- May be relevant if correspondent banking relationships involved
- **Shell bank dealings might indicate institutional non-compliance**

---

#### Section 4: Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) (Article 15)

**In ADDITION to standard CDD measures (Articles 5-14), Enhanced requirements for PEPs**

**Clause 1: Foreign PEPs**

**Requirements for Financial Institutions and DNFBPs:**

**(a) Risk Management Systems:**
- Put in place suitable systems to **determine whether customer or Beneficial Owner is PEP**

**(b) Senior Management Approval:**
- Obtain **senior management approval** BEFORE:
  - Establishing business relationship, OR
  - Continuing existing relationship with PEP

**(c) Source of Funds Verification:**
- Take **reasonable measures** to establish **source of funds** of customers and Beneficial Owners identified as PEPs

**(d) Enhanced Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Conduct **enhanced ongoing monitoring** over relationship

**Clause 1 Second: Domestic PEPs and International Organisation Officials**

**Requirements:**

**(a) Identification Measures:**
- Take **sufficient measures** to identify whether customer/Beneficial Owner is:
  - Domestic PEP, OR
  - Individual previously entrusted with prominent functions at international organisations

**(b) Conditional Enhanced Measures:**
- Apply measures (b), (c), (d) from Foreign PEPs section ONLY when:
  - **High-risk business relationship** accompanies such persons

**Clause 2: Life Insurance for PEP Beneficiaries**

Financial institutions must:
- Take **reasonable measures** to determine if beneficiary/Beneficial Owner of life insurance/takaful is PEP
- **If PEP identified:**
  - Inform **senior management** BEFORE:
    - Pay-out of policies, OR
    - Exercise of any policy rights
  - **Thoroughly examine** overall business relationship
  - **Consider reporting** Suspicious Transaction to FIU

**🎯 Critical Defense Analysis:**

**PEP Status ≠ Criminality:**
- PEP designation is **preventive measure**, not evidence of crime
- Enhanced CDD recognizes higher corruption risk in public office
- **Defense argument:** PEP status alone cannot support ML prosecution

**Senior Management Approval Requirement:**
- **Was approval actually obtained?**
- **Documented approval or oral approval?**
- **Lack of approval = institutional non-compliance**

**"Reasonable Measures" for Source of Funds:**
- Again, vague standard
- **What constitutes "reasonable"?**
  - Employment income verification?
  - Asset declarations?
  - Tax returns?
  - Wealth statements?
- **Defense:** Challenge adequacy of source of funds investigation

**Enhanced Monitoring Obligation:**
- What does "enhanced ongoing monitoring" entail?
- More frequent reviews? Lower thresholds for STR? Automated alerts?
- **If monitoring was "enhanced," why did institution miss legitimate explanations?**

**Domestic PEPs - Conditional Approach:**
- Domestic PEPs get relaxed treatment UNLESS high-risk relationship
- **Defense questions:**
  - What made relationship "high-risk"?
  - Was risk assessment documented?
  - Were enhanced measures actually applied?

**Life Insurance PEP Beneficiaries:**
- "Consider reporting" to FIU = discretionary, not mandatory
- **Defense:** On what basis did institution decide to report (or not report)?

**Key Defense Strategy:**
- PEP Enhanced CDD creates extensive paper trail
- **Demand production of:**
  - PEP screening results
  - Senior management approval documentation
  - Source of funds verification evidence
  - Enhanced monitoring reports
- **Gaps in documentation undermine institutional credibility**

---

#### Section 5: Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) (Articles 16-18)

**Article 16: STR Indicators**

**Requirements:**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must:
1. **Put in place indicators** that can be used to identify suspicion of Crime
2. **Update indicators on ongoing basis** as required
3. Comply with indicators issued by:
   - Supervisory Authorities, OR
   - FIU

**Purpose:** Account for development and diversity of methods used for committing crimes

**🎯 Case Relevance:**

**Indicator-Based Suspicion:**
- Institutions rely on "red flag" indicators to trigger STRs
- **Defense strategy:** Obtain institution's indicator list
- **Questions:**
  - Were indicators comprehensive and up-to-date?
  - Did transaction actually match any indicator?
  - Were indicators overly broad or vague?

**Indicator Development:**
- Who develops indicators? Compliance officer? External consultant?
- Were indicators based on:
  - FIU guidance?
  - Industry best practices?
  - Institution's own experience?
  - **Or outdated/generic lists?**

**Updates Required:**
- Indicators must be updated "on ongoing basis"
- **Defense:** When was last update? Were indicators current at time of transaction?

---

**Article 17: STR Filing Obligations**

**Clause 1: Mandatory STR Filing**

**Trigger:** If financial institutions and DNFBPs have **"reasonable grounds to suspect"** that:
- Transaction, OR
- Attempted transaction, OR
- Funds

Constitute crime proceeds (whole or part), OR are related to Crime, OR intended to be used in Crime

**REGARDLESS OF AMOUNT**

**Obligations:**

**(a) Direct Reporting to FIU:**
- Report **without any delay**
- Via **FIU electronic system** or other FIU-approved means
- **Cannot invoke:**
  - Bank secrecy
  - Professional secrecy
  - Contractual secrecy

**(b) Response to FIU:**
- Respond to **all additional information requests** from FIU

**Clause 2: Legal Professional Exemption**

**Lawyers, notary publics, legal stakeholders, legal auditors EXEMPT from Clause 1 IF:**

Information relates to:
- Assessment of customer's **legal position**
- **Defending or representing** customer before:
  - Judiciary authorities
  - Arbitration
  - Mediation
- Providing **legal opinion** regarding legal proceedings
- Consultation about **initiating or avoiding** legal proceedings

**Applies to information obtained:**
- Before legal proceedings
- During legal proceedings
- After completion of legal proceedings
- In circumstances subject to **professional secrecy**

**Clause 3: Good Faith Protection**

Financial institutions, DNFBPs, **their board members, employees, authorized representatives:**

**NOT legally liable** (administrative, civil, or criminal) for reporting to FIU or providing information **in good faith**

**🎯 CRITICAL DEFENSE ANALYSIS:**

**"Reasonable Grounds to Suspect" Standard:**

This is THE central issue in most ML defense cases.

**Key Questions:**
1. What is "reasonable"? (Objective standard)
2. What are "grounds"? (Factual basis, not speculation)
3. What is "suspect"? (Lower than "believe" or "know")

**Standard Hierarchy:**
- **Know** (highest - actual knowledge)
- **Believe** (high probability)
- **Suspect** (possibility based on facts)
- **Guess** (speculation without factual basis)

**Defense Arguments:**
- **Suspicion must be reasonable, not subjective**
- **Grounds must be articulable facts, not hunches**
- **Post-hoc rationalization:** Did suspicion exist at time of transaction, or was it created after investigation?

**"Regardless of Amount" Provision:**
- STR required even for small transactions if suspicion exists
- **Defense:** If transaction was small, what created suspicion?
- **Amount itself may negate risk** (de minimis transactions)

**"Without Any Delay" Requirement:**
- How quickly did institution report?
- **Long delay may indicate:**
  - Lack of actual suspicion
  - Institutional indecision
  - Retrofitting suspicion after other events

**Cannot Invoke Secrecy:**
- Bank secrecy, professional secrecy, contractual secrecy cannot be used to avoid STR
- **But see Clause 2 exemption for legal professionals**

**Legal Professional Exemption - CRITICAL:**
- Lawyers have LIMITED exemption when:
  - Assessing legal position
  - Defending/representing client
  - Providing legal opinions
  - Subject to professional secrecy

**Defense Strategy for Legal Professional Exemption:**
- If lawyer/legal professional filed STR, was exemption applicable?
- **Was information obtained in professional secrecy context?**
- **Was lawyer acting as legal advisor or as DNFBP?**

**Good Faith Protection:**
- Institutions have legal immunity for STR filings
- **Creates incentive for over-reporting**
- **Defense argument:** Institution may have filed defensively without true suspicion

**Burden of Proof Issues:**
- Who bears burden of proving "reasonable grounds to suspect"?
- In criminal trial, prosecution must prove ML elements beyond reasonable doubt
- **But STR standard is lower**
- **Defense must show STR was unreasonable/unfounded to undermine prosecution case**

---

**Article 18: Prohibition on "Tipping Off"**

**Clause 1: Non-Disclosure Obligation**

Financial institutions, DNFBPs, **their managers, officials, or staff** must NOT disclose (directly or indirectly) to:
- Customer, OR
- Any other person(s)

That they have:
- **Reported** STR, OR
- **Are intending to report** STR

Nor shall they disclose:
- Information or data contained in STR
- That investigation is being conducted

**Clause 2: Exception for Legal Professionals**

**Lawyers, notaries, independent legal professionals, legal auditors:**

**NOT considered to have made disclosure** when they attempt to:
- **Discourage customers from committing violation**

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**"Tipping Off" Prohibition Purpose:**
- Prevent customer from:
  - Destroying evidence
  - Fleeing jurisdiction
  - Moving assets
  - Altering transaction patterns

**Defense Challenges:**

**Indirect "Tipping Off":**
- What constitutes "indirect" disclosure?
- Account freeze without explanation?
- Sudden transaction scrutiny?
- Requests for additional documentation?
- **Could customer infer STR from institutional behavior?**

**Investigation Knowledge:**
- Prohibition extends to disclosing "that investigation is being conducted"
- **But customers may learn of investigation from other sources:**
  - Law enforcement inquiries
  - Asset freezes
  - Media reports

**Legal Professional Exception:**
- Lawyers can attempt to "discourage customers from committing violation"
- **This is advice, not disclosure of STR**
- **Defense:** Lawyer has duty to advise client against unlawful conduct

**Practical Defense Implications:**
- STR is secret - defense may not know it exists until:
  - Prosecution disclosure
  - Asset freeze order
  - Criminal charges filed
- **Request in discovery:**
  - All STRs filed relating to client
  - Dates of STR filings
  - Basis for each STR

**Institutional "Tipping Off" Violations:**
- If institution violated Article 18 by disclosing STR:
  - Undermines investigation
  - But may benefit defense (client had notice)
  - **Evidence of institutional non-compliance**

- **Immediately obtain** from third party:
  - Necessary identification data
  - Other information collected through CDD
- Ensure **copies of documents** can be obtained:
  - **Without delay**
  - **Upon request**

**(b) Third Party Compliance:**
- Ensure third party is:
  - **Regulated and supervised**
  - **Adheres to CDD measures**
  - **Adheres to record-keeping** requirements of this Decision

**Important:** Financial institution/DNFBP remains **responsible for validity of CDD measures**

**Restriction:** Consider **high-risk countries** identified by National Committee

- Financial Group subject to supervision

**(b) High-Risk Country Mitigation:**
- Financial Group **sufficiently mitigates** high risks linked to countries
- Through own policies and controls

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Third Party Reliance - Responsibility Issue:**
- Institution can rely on third party for CDD execution
- **But institution remains responsible for validity**
- **Defense questions:**
  - Did institution verify third party's CDD quality?
  - Did institution obtain actual CDD documents?
  - **Or did institution blindly trust third party?**

**Common Third Party Scenarios:**
- Correspondent banking relationships
- Introducing brokers
- Professional intermediaries (lawyers, accountants)
- Parent-subsidiary relationships
- **Defense:** Was third party properly vetted?

**Information Availability Requirement:**
- Third party CDD documents must be available **"without delay"**
- **Defense strategy:**
  - Request production of third party CDD documents
  - If unavailable or delayed → institution violated Article 19
  - **Undermines STR credibility**

**Financial Group Reliance:**
- Relaxed requirements for affiliated entities
- **But group-wide compliance still required**
- **Defense:** Did Financial Group actually have compliant policies?

---

- Related to combating Crime

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Internal Policies as Evidence:**
- Institution's own policies establish standard of care
- **Defense strategy:**
  - Obtain institution's internal AML/CFT policies
  - Compare actual conduct to written policies
  - **Gaps = institutional non-compliance**

**Risk Management Before Verification:**
- Policies must address **managing risks before CDD complete** (per Article 5 exception)
- **If customer benefited before verification, were risk controls actually applied?**

**Compliance Officer Appointment:**
- Failure to appoint compliance officer = violation
- **Who was compliance officer at time of transaction?**
- **Was officer properly trained and empowered?**

**Staff Screening:**
- Competence and compatibility screening required
- **Defense questions:**
  - Was compliance staff actually screened?

**🎯 Critical Defense Analysis:**

**Compliance Officer as Key Witness:**
- Compliance officer makes STR filing decision
- **Defense must depose/cross-examine compliance officer:**
  - What facts created suspicion?
  - What analysis was conducted?
  - What alternative explanations were considered?
  - Why was transaction not maintained?

**"Under Own Responsibility" Language:**
- Compliance officer personally responsible for decisions
- **Defense strategy:**
  - Challenge officer's qualifications
  - Question officer's training
  - Examine officer's track record (false positives?)

**Decision to Maintain vs. Report:**
- Compliance officer decides: report or maintain
- **Must document reasons for maintaining**
- **Defense:**
  - Were reasons for "maintaining" carefully considered?
  - **Or was reporting reflexive/defensive?**

**Semi-Annual Reports:**
- Compliance officer reports to senior management **twice per year**
- Reports must identify:
  - Compliance gaps

---

#### Section 9: High-Risk Countries (Article 22)

**Clause 1: Enhanced CDD for High-Risk Countries**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must implement **Enhanced CDD measures** proportionate to risk level from:
- Business relationships with natural/legal persons **from high-risk countries**
- Transactions with natural/legal persons **from high-risk countries**

**Clause 2: National Committee Measures**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must implement measures defined by **National Committee for AML/CFT** regarding High Risk Countries

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**High-Risk Country Designation:**
- National Committee (not individual institutions) designates high-risk countries
- **Typically based on:**
  - FATF "grey list" or "black list"
  - Countries with weak AML/CFT systems
  - Countries subject to UN sanctions

**Enhanced CDD Requirement:**
- Transactions involving high-risk countries trigger Enhanced CDD
- **Defense questions:**
  - Was Enhanced CDD actually performed?
  - What enhanced measures were applied?
  - **Or did institution apply standard CDD?**

**Proportionality:**
- Enhanced CDD must be "proportionate to risk level"
- **Not all high-risk country transactions are equal**
- **Defense:** Was enhanced scrutiny warranted for specific transaction?

**Geographic Risk vs. Individual Risk:**
- Country designation = geographic risk
- **Does not mean all transactions with that country are suspicious**
- **Defense:** Challenge conflation of geographic risk with individual suspicion

---

#### Section 10: Requirements Relating to New Technologies (Article 23)

**Clause 1: Risk Assessment for New Products/Technologies**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must:
- **Identify and assess ML/FT risks** that may arise from:

- Take **appropriate measures to manage and mitigate** such risks

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**New Technology Risks:**
- Cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, online banking, mobile payments
- **If institution offered new product/service, did they conduct pre-launch risk assessment?**

**Generally Less Relevant to Defense:**
- Usually impacts institutional compliance, not individual prosecutions
- **May be relevant if:**
  - Transaction involved new technology
  - Institution claims they couldn't detect risk due to new platform
  - **Defense: Institution failed to conduct required risk assessment**

---

#### Section 11: Record-Keeping (Article 24)

**Clause 1: Transaction Records - 5-Year Retention**

Financial institutions and DNFBPs must maintain **ALL** records, documents, data, statistics for:

  - Ongoing monitoring
  - Results of analysis
- Records, files, documents, correspondence, forms

**🎯 CRITICAL DEFENSE ANALYSIS:**

**5-Year Retention = Discovery Goldmine:**

- **Defense strategy:**
  - Request ALL records relating to client
  - Transaction records
  - CDD documentation
  - Monitoring logs
  - Internal communications
  - Analysis notes
  - STR drafts and final versions

**"ALL" Records Requirement:**
- Regulation says "ALL" - not "some" or "relevant"
- **Missing records = institutional non-compliance**

**Multiple 5-Year Triggers:**
- Retention period can extend beyond basic 5 years if:
  - Inspection ongoing
  - Judicial proceedings pending
- **In ML prosecution, records MUST be preserved throughout case**

**Organization for Analysis:**
- Records must be organized to permit tracking
- **Defense:**
  - If records disorganized, undermines institutional competence
  - If institution cannot track transaction flow, how did they determine suspicion?

**Immediate Availability:**
- "Immediately available" = no delay permitted
- **Defense:**
  - Request production with tight deadline
  - Any delay suggests records missing/incomplete
  - **Burden is on institution to maintain readily accessible records**

**Reconstruction of Institutional Decision-Making:**
- Records should show:
  - When transaction occurred
  - What monitoring alerts triggered
  - What analysis was performed
  - What compliance officer concluded
  - **Timeline of STR decision**
- **Gaps in records = reasonable doubt about institutional determination**

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Generally Less Relevant to Individual ML Prosecutions:**
- Applies to institutional correspondent banking arrangements
- **May be relevant if:**
  - Alleged ML involved correspondent banking channels
  - Funds routed through correspondent accounts

**Institutional Due Diligence Failures:**
- If prosecution claims funds moved through correspondent bank:
  - **Did UAE financial institution conduct required due diligence?**
  - **Did receiving bank have adequate anti-crime controls?**
  - **Was senior management approval obtained?**

**Defense Strategy:**
- Correspondent banking creates multiple intermediaries
- **Complex chains obscure beneficial ownership**
- **Challenge prosecution's ability to trace funds through correspondent relationships**

---

#### Section 2: Money or Value Transfer Services (Article 26)

**Clause 1: Licensing/Registration Requirement**

Providers of money or value transfer services (MVTS) must be:

**🎯 Case Relevance:**

**Hawala and Informal Value Transfer:**
- Article 26 targets regulation of money remitters (Western Union, MoneyGram, hawala)
- **Unlicensed MVTS operation is separate violation**

**Defense Applications:**
- If client used unlicensed MVTS:
  - **Unlicensed status ≠ money laundering**
  - May indicate intent to evade regulation
  - **But defense: many legitimate users of informal remitters**

**Agent Compliance:**
- MVTS must monitor agents
- **If violation occurred through agent:**
  - Was agent properly supervised?

  - **Principal's failure to supervise agent may indicate systemic problems**

---

#### Section 3: Wire Transfers (Articles 27-30)

**Financial institutions must NOT carry out wire transfers** if fail to comply with this article

**Clause 7: Record-Keeping**

Ordering financial institutions must keep all originator and beneficiary information (per Article 24 - 5 years)

**🎯 CRITICAL DEFENSE ANALYSIS:**

**AED 3,500 Threshold for Wire Transfers:**
- **Lower than AED 55,000 general CDD threshold**
- Reflects international wire transfer risks
- **Defense:** Small wire transfers attract scrutiny

**Required Originator Information:**
- **Complete identification required**
- Name, ID, DOB, place of birth, address, account
- **Defense questions:**
  - Was complete information actually provided?
  - Was information accurate?
  - **Missing/inaccurate information = sending institution violated Article 27**

**Batch Transfer Loophole:**
- Batch transfers have relaxed requirements
- **Defense:** Were multiple transfers improperly batched to avoid full disclosure?

**Domestic vs. International Distinction:**
- **Domestic transfers:** Reduced information requirements IF available by other means
- **International transfers:** Full information always required
- **Defense:** Routing through domestic transfer first may reduce information trail

**"Without Need to Verify Accuracy" (Clause 3):**
- For international wire transfers < AED 3,500:
  - Information required but not verified
  - **UNLESS suspicion exists**
- **Defense:** Institution cannot claim "verified" information if below threshold

**Non-Compliance Prohibition:**
- Institution **must not** execute wire transfer if cannot comply
- **Defense:**
  - If transfer was executed, implies institution believed it complied
  - **Or institution violated Article 27 by executing non-compliant transfer**

**Record-Keeping:**
- All wire transfer information retained 5 years
- **Defense:** Request production of wire transfer records, including:
  - Originator information provided
  - Beneficiary information provided
  - Any verification conducted
  - **Gaps = institutional non-compliance**

---

- Have **risk-based policies and procedures** for determining when to:
  - Execute transfer
  - Reject transfer
  - Suspend transfer
- Determine appropriate **follow-up action**

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Intermediary Role:**
- Multiple intermediaries in international wire transfers
- **Each intermediary must retain information**

**"Technical Limitations" Exception:**
- Vague standard
- **Defense:** What constitutes "technical limitation"?
- **Or is this excuse for incomplete information?**

**Straight-Through Processing:**
- Automated processing of wire transfers
- **Limited manual review**
- **Defense:**
  - Intermediary may have processed transfer without meaningful review
  - **Automated processing may miss red flags**

**Risk-Based Policies:**
- Intermediary must have policies for missing information
- **Defense:**
  - Request production of intermediary's policies
  - Did intermediary follow own policies?
  - **If executed transfer despite missing information, why?**

---

- Reject transfer
- Suspend transfer

When lacking required originator or beneficiary information

Determine appropriate **follow-up action**

**Clause 4: Record-Keeping**

Must maintain records of all required originator and beneficiary information (per Article 24 - 5 years)

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Beneficiary Institution as Final Gatekeeper:**
- Last chance to detect missing information
- **Should have verified beneficiary identity**

**Identity Verification Obligation:**
- For transfers ≥ AED 3,500, beneficiary identity must be verified
- **Defense questions:**
  - Was beneficiary identity actually verified?
  - What documents were used?
  - **If not verified, beneficiary institution violated Article 29**

**Risk-Based Policies:**
- **"Execute, reject, or suspend" decision**
- **Defense:**
  - On what basis did beneficiary institution decide to execute?
  - Were there red flags that should have triggered rejection?
  - **If executed, implies institution found no reasonable grounds to suspect**

**Post-Event Monitoring:**
- Monitoring may occur after transfer executed
- **Defense:** Retroactive suspicion less reliable than real-time detection

---

**Article 30: Money/Value Transfer Services Providers**

**Clause 1: Full Compliance Required**

MVTS providers must comply with Articles 27, 28, 29:
- Whether operating directly, OR

- If decided to file STR:
  - STR sent to FIU in **relevant country**
  - Attach **all relevant transaction information**

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**MVTS Comprehensive View:**
- MVTS seeing both sides has complete picture
- **Should have best information to assess suspicion**

**Defense Strategy:**
- If MVTS controlled both sides:
  - **Request ALL information from both ordering and beneficiary sides**
  - **MVTS had duty to analyze both sides**
  - If STR filed, what information from BOTH sides created suspicion?

**Dual Reporting:**
- STR may be filed in multiple countries
- **Coordination between FIUs**
- **Defense:** International STR filings may create appearance of widespread criminality, but may be based on same underlying facts

---

- **Inform Supervisory Authority** in UAE
- **Abide by instructions** received from Supervisory Authority

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Extraterritorial Application:**
- UAE standards apply to UAE institutions' foreign operations
- **Unless foreign law prohibits**

**Defense Strategy:**
- If alleged ML involved foreign branch/subsidiary:
  - **Did foreign branch apply UAE standards?**
  - **Or did foreign law prevent application?**
  - Were additional risk mitigation measures taken?
  - **Was Supervisory Authority notified of conflict?**

**Conflict of Laws:**

  - **Discrepancies may indicate institutional errors, not client wrongdoing**

**Beneficial Owner Registry:**
- Registrar has Beneficial Owner information
- Available to **Relevant Authorities** (not general public)
- **Defense:**

## CHAPTER 6: PROVISIONAL MEASURES AND INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES

### Section 1: Provisional Measures (Articles 46-48)

**🔥 CRITICAL FOR MONEY LAUNDERING DEFENSE 🔥**

**Clause 1: 7-Day Administrative Freeze**

**Governor** (or acting in place) shall order **Freezing of funds** suspected to be linked to Crime

**With Financial Institutions licensed by Central Bank**

**Maximum Period:** No more than **7 working days**

**Trigger:** FIU request based on:
- Analysis of STRs
- Other information received

**Clause 2: FIU Actions Upon Freezing**

- For public prosecutor to take appropriate actions

**Clause 6: Execution Restriction**

Fund freezing orders executed by Financial Institutions licensed by Central Bank **ONLY IF** issued by Central Bank

**🎯 CRITICAL DEFENSE ANALYSIS:**

**7-Day Administrative Freeze - NO JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT:**

This is one of most powerful (and potentially abusive) provisions in regulation.

**Key Issues:**

**1. No Prior Judicial Authorization:**
- Governor (executive authority) orders freeze
- **No court order required**
- **No hearing before freeze imposed**
- **Immediate deprivation of property without due process**

**2. "Without Prior Notice to Owner":**
- Owner learns of freeze AFTER it is imposed
- **No opportunity to contest before freeze**
- **Assets frozen without warning**

**3. Based on FIU "Analysis":**
- FIU analyzes STRs and other information
- **"Analysis" may be preliminary, incomplete**
- **May be based on single STR without investigation**

**4. 7-Day Maximum (Unless Extended):**
- Freeze limited to 7 working days
- **BUT can be extended by public prosecutor**
- **No stated limit on extensions**

**5. Owner Can Provide Evidence:**
- Financial institution must notify owner
- Owner can provide documents proving legitimacy
- **But funds remain frozen during this process**

**Defense Strategies:**

**A. Challenge Basis for Freeze:**
- What STRs or information formed basis?
- Was FIU analysis adequate?
- **Demand production of FIU analysis underlying freeze**

**B. Contest Extension:**
- If freeze extended beyond 7 days, on what basis?
- Did public prosecutor properly evaluate justifications?
- **Article 47(3) allows contesting freeze before competent court**

**C. Legitimacy of Source:**
- Provide comprehensive evidence of legitimate source of funds
- **Article 46(4) contemplates owner proving legitimacy**
- Gather:
  - Employment records
  - Business income documentation
  - Tax returns
  - Asset sales documentation
  - Inheritance records
  - Loan documentation
- **Submit to FIU through institution**

**D. Time Pressure:**
- 7-day clock creates urgency
- **Must act quickly to contest or provide evidence**
- **Delay risks automatic extension**

**E. Due Process Arguments:**
- Administrative freeze without judicial review may violate:
  - Constitutional protections
  - International human rights standards
  - Right to property
  - Right to fair hearing
- **Consider constitutional challenge if applicable**

**F. Relationship to Criminal Prosecution:**
- Article 46 freeze is **administrative**, not criminal
- **Lower standard than criminal prosecution**
- Freeze does NOT prove crime occurred
- **Defense: Administrative freeze ≠ criminal conviction**

---

**Article 47: Public Prosecution and Court Freezing/Seizing Power**

**Clause 1: Judicial Freezing and Seizing**

**Public Prosecution** and **competent court** (as case may be) shall order:
- **Identification, tracing, valuation** of:

**Clause 4: Contest Procedure**

Contest submitted as **report to competent court**

**Court president** must:
- Schedule hearing session with knowledge of defendant

**Court issues final decision:** Within **no more than 14 working days** from date of submission of appeal

**Clause 5: Appeal Restrictions**

- Decision to **dismiss contest NOT subject to appeal**
- If contest **rejected:**
  - NOT permissible to lodge new contest
  - **Except after 3 months** from date of rejecting contest
  - **UNLESS serious reason occurs** before period passes

**🎯 CRITICAL DEFENSE ANALYSIS:**

**Article 47 vs. Article 46:**
- **Article 46:** Administrative freeze by Central Bank Governor (7 days)
- **Article 47:** Judicial freeze/seizure by Public Prosecution/Court (indefinite)

**Progression:**
1. FIU files STR
2. FIU requests Governor to freeze (Article 46) - 7 days
3. FIU notifies Public Prosecutor to extend
4. Public Prosecutor issues Freezing/Seizing order (Article 47) - indefinite
5. Court may later issue Freezing/Seizing order during prosecution

**Key Differences:**

**No Time Limit:**
- Article 47 freeze has **no maximum duration**
- Remains in effect until:
  - Investigation complete
  - Trial complete
  - Confiscation ordered
  - Order lifted
- **Can last years**

**Travel Ban:**
- Article 47 includes **travel ban** for owner
- **Significant additional restriction on liberty**
- Until investigation or trial complete

**Right to Contest:**
- Unlike Article 46, **explicit right to contest** before court
- **14-day decision deadline**
- **But dismissed contest not appealable**

**Defense Strategies:**

**A. File Contest Immediately:**
- Article 47(3) provides right to contest
- **Must act within reasonable time**
- File contest report with competent court

**B. Contest Grounds:**
- **Lack of probable cause:**
  - Public Prosecution must have reasonable grounds
  - Challenge sufficiency of evidence
  - **STR alone may be insufficient**
- **No link to Crime:**
  - Funds not result of Crime
  - Funds not linked to Crime
  - **Legitimate source of funds**
- **Bona fide third party rights:**
  - Funds belong to innocent third party
  - Third party had no knowledge of alleged Crime
  - **Third party protections under Clause 2**

**C. 14-Day Decision Requirement:**
- Court must decide **within 14 working days**
- **Delays may violate procedural rights**
- **Track deadline carefully**

**D. Public Prosecution Memorandum:**
- Public Prosecution must submit opinion on contest
- **Defense can respond to prosecution's memorandum**
- **Opportunity for written advocacy**

**E. 3-Month Waiting Period:**
- If contest rejected, cannot re-contest for 3 months
- **UNLESS "serious reason" occurs**
- **What constitutes "serious reason"?**
  - New exculpatory evidence
  - Change in circumstances
  - Prosecution drops investigation
- **Argue broadly for "serious reason" exception**

**F. Evidence of Legitimacy:**
- Present comprehensive evidence of legitimate source:
  - Employment income
  - Business profits
  - Asset sales
  - Inheritance
  - Gifts (properly documented)
  - Loans (with documentation)
- **Burden may shift to defense to prove legitimacy**

**G. Proportionality Arguments:**
- Is freeze/seizure proportionate to alleged offense?
- **Excessive seizure may violate property rights**
- **Freeze of ALL assets may prevent mounting defense**

**H. Bona Fide Third Party Rights:**
- If funds held jointly or belong to others:
  - **Identify innocent third parties**
  - **Provide evidence of third party ownership**
  - **Clause 2 protects bona fide third party rights**

---

**Article 48: Management and Sale of Seized/Frozen Assets**

**Public Prosecution and Competent Court Shall:**

**Appoint Manager:**
- Whomever deemed suitable
- To manage:
  - Seized Funds, Proceeds, Means
  - Frozen Funds, Proceeds, Means

**🎯 Defense Analysis:**

**Pre-Conviction Sale:**
- Most controversial aspect
- Assets can be **sold before conviction**
- **"If necessary" and "concerned about depreciation/devaluation"**

**Defense Challenges:**

**A. Oppose Pre-Conviction Sale:**
- **Presumption of innocence violated?**
- Sale is irreversible if acquitted
- **Money can be returned, but specific asset cannot**
- **Examples:**
  - Real estate: Unique property, may have sentimental value
  - Business: Sale destroys going concern
  - Collectibles: May appreciate, not depreciate

**B. Valuation Disputes:**
- Who determines value?
- **Public auction may not achieve fair market value**
- **Distressed sale conditions depress prices**

**C. "Necessity" Requirement:**
- Sale only "if necessary"
- **Challenge necessity:**
  - Are assets actually depreciating?
  - Can assets be maintained without sale?
  - **Burden on prosecution to prove necessity**

**D. Bona Fide Third Party Rights:**
- Sale proceeds must account for innocent third party rights
- **But sale eliminates third party's rights to specific asset**
- **Third party may prefer asset over money**

**E. Alternative Relief:**
- Request court to:
  - Maintain assets without sale
  - Allow defendant to pay maintenance costs
  - Post bond in lieu of sale
  - **Preserve assets for potential return if acquitted**

## 📊 COMPARISON: Cabinet Decision 10/2019 vs 134/2025

| **Aspect** | **CD 10/2019 (Old)** | **CD 134/2025 (New)** | **Impact on Defense** |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Parent Law** | FD-L 20/2018 | FD-L 10/2025 | New law effective 14 Oct 2025; cases before that date use old framework |
| **CDD Threshold** | AED 55,000 | [Likely unchanged] | Structuring below threshold may be evidence of evasion |
| **Wire Transfer Threshold** | AED 3,500 | [Likely unchanged] | Lower threshold captures more transactions |
| **STR Standard** | "Reasonable grounds to suspect" | [Likely unchanged] | Core defense issue remains same |
| **FIU Freeze Power** | 7 working days | [Unknown if changed] | Short window to contest; may be extended |

## 🚨 CASE APPLICATION NOTES

### If Client's Case is Under OLD Law (FD-L 20/2018 + CD 10/2019):

**This Regulation FULLY APPLIES**

**Focus Articles:**
- Articles 17 (STR), 46-47 (Freezing), 4 (Risk Assessment), 24 (Records)

**Key Defense Arguments:**
1. **Challenge STR basis** under "reasonable grounds to suspect" standard
2. **Contest administrative freeze** under Article 46 or judicial freeze under Article 47
3. **Demand comprehensive records** under Article 24 (5-year retention)
4. **Question institutional risk assessment** under Article 4
5. **Examine compliance officer qualifications** under Article 21

**Discovery Requests:**
- All STRs filed relating to client (Article 17)
- FIU analysis and operational reports (Article 42)
- Institution's risk assessment documents (Article 4)
- CDD records and beneficial owner identification (Articles 8-9)
- Compliance officer training records (Article 21)
- All transaction records (Article 24 - 5 years)
- Semi-annual compliance reports to Supervisory Authority (Article 21)
- Supervisory Authority inspection reports (Article 44)

**Timeline Considerations:**
- Case initiated before 14 October 2025 → OLD framework applies
- Focus on regulatory requirements in effect at time of transaction
- Institutional compliance measured against CD 10/2019 standards

---

### If Client's Case is Under NEW Law (FD-L 10/2025 + CD 134/2025):

**Cabinet Decision 134/2025 APPLIES**

**But CD 10/2019 Remains Relevant For:**
1. **Understanding regulatory evolution:** Compare old vs. new provisions
2. **Historical context:** If transactions occurred before 14 Oct 2025
3. **Transitional period issues:** When did institution update policies?
4. **Baseline compliance expectations:** New regulation likely builds on old framework

**Defense Strategy:**
1. **Obtain Cabinet Decision 134/2025** (if publicly available)
2. **Compare provisions** to identify significant changes
3. **Identify favorable changes** that might support defense
4. **Retroactivity arguments** if new regulation less favorable to defense

**Potential Retroactivity Issues:**
- Can new, stricter provisions be applied to past conduct?
- **Generally, criminal law principle:** More favorable law applies
- **Defense argument:** If CD 134/2025 has higher thresholds or more protections, those should apply

- Percentage of STRs leading to investigation
- Percentage of investigations leading to prosecution

- Average value of frozen/seized assets
- Number of Article 46 freezes annually
- Number of Article 47 freezes annually
- Administrative sanctions imposed on institutions

**Context for Defense:**
- If institution has high STR volume but low conversion to prosecution → suggests over-reporting
- If FIU refers small percentage to Law Enforcement → suggests high false positive rate
- If prosecutions have low conviction rate → suggests weak cases generally

## 🎓 KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR DEFENSE COUNSEL

**1. "Reasonable Grounds to Suspect" is Central:**
- Lower standard than "probable cause" or "beyond reasonable doubt"
- But requires **objective, articulable facts**, not speculation
- **Challenge sufficiency of factual basis**

**2. Records are Your Friend:**
- 5-year retention requirement (Article 24) creates comprehensive discovery
- **Request EVERYTHING**
- Missing records = institutional non-compliance → undermines credibility

**3. Compliance Officer is Key Witness:**
- Made STR filing decision
- **Must depose thoroughly**
- Training, qualifications, methodology all relevant

**4. FIU Analysis is Discoverable:**
- Article 42 operational/strategic analysis
- Forms basis for Law Enforcement referral
- **Demand production**

**5. Freezes Require Immediate Action:**
- Article 46: 7-day administrative freeze (act fast)
- Article 47: Judicial freeze (contest within 14 days)
- **Time is of the essence**

**6. PEP Status ≠ Guilt:**
- Enhanced CDD is preventive
- **Not evidence of crime**
- Distinguish compliance requirements from criminal liability

**7. Risk Assessment is Subjective:**
- Article 4 risk classification depends on institutional judgment
- **Challenge methodology**
- **Demand documentation**

**8. Institutional Non-Compliance Cuts Both Ways:**
- Violations by institution may undermine STR
- **But may also suggest lax oversight that enabled ML**

**9. International Cooperation is Extensive:**
- Information shared with many countries
- Foreign evidence may be incorporated
- **Limited ability to challenge foreign evidence**

**10. Historical Context Matters:**
- Cases before 14 Oct 2025 use OLD framework (CD 10/2019)
- Cases after 14 Oct 2025 use NEW framework (CD 134/2025)
- **Identify applicable regulation**
