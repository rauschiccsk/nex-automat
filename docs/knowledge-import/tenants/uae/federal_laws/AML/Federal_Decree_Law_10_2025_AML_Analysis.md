## 📋 LEGISLATIVE STATUS

**Effective Date:** 14 October 2025  
**Published:** UAE Official Gazette, 30 September 2025  
**Repeals:** Federal Decree-Law No. 20/2018 (AML Law)  
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE - Current Law

## 🎯 KEY CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS LAW (20/2018)

### 1. 🚨 LOWERED EVIDENTIARY THRESHOLD (CRITICAL FOR DEFENSE)

**OLD LAW (20/2018):**
> Required proof of **"actual knowledge"** that funds were proceeds of crime (subjective test)

**NEW LAW (10/2025) - Article 2:**
> "Anyone who **knows, or has sufficient evidence or circumstantial evidence to support his knowledge**, that all or some of the funds are derived from a predicate crime..."

**Key Impact:**
- Knowledge can be **"inferred from factual and objective circumstances"**
- **NO longer required** to prove actual knowledge
- **Objective test** - "should have known" is sufficient
- Prosecutors have MUCH lower burden of proof

**⚠️ TEMPORAL APPLICATION QUESTION:**
If accused was convicted BEFORE 14 October 2025, OLD LAW may apply (principle of lex mitior - more lenient law)

---

### 2. EXPANDED DEFINITION OF MONEY LAUNDERING

**Article 2 - Money Laundering Crime:**

A person commits money laundering if they know (or should have known) funds are from a predicate crime and:

a) **Converts, transfers**, or carries out any transaction to **conceal or disguise** illicit origin  
b) **Conceals or disguises** true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, ownership  
c) **Acquires, possesses, or uses** the proceeds upon receipt  
d) **Assists the perpetrator** of predicate offence in evading punishment

**NEW:** Explicitly includes:
- Digital systems
- Virtual assets
- Encryption technologies

---

### 3. PREDICATE OFFENCES EXPANDED

**Predicate Offence now includes:**
- Any felony or misdemeanor (as before)
- **Terrorist financing** (NEW)
- **Arms proliferation financing** (NEW)
- **Direct and indirect tax evasion** (NEW)

**Article 2, Clause 3 - Critical for Defense:**
> "Conviction of the Predicate Offence shall **NOT be required** to establish the illegitimate source of the Proceeds, **nor shall it be required to prove knowledge of the specific type or nature** of the predicate offence from which the proceeds were derived."

---

### 4. BURDEN OF PROOF

**Key Provision:**
> "Such knowledge, being an element of the Crime, **may be inferred from the factual and objective circumstances**"

**What this means:**
- Prosecution does NOT need to prove defendant knew specific crime
- Prosecution does NOT need conviction of predicate offence
- **Circumstantial evidence is SUFFICIENT**

**Defense Strategy Consideration:**
- Focus on demonstrating legitimate source
- Show NO reasonable grounds to suspect illicit origin
- Prove due diligence in transaction verification

---

### 5. PENALTIES (SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED)

**Individuals:**
- Imprisonment + Fine
- Confiscation of criminal property
- Deportation (for foreigners)

**Legal Entities:**
- **Fine: AED 5-100 million** (or value of criminal property if higher)
- Previously: AED 500,000 - 50 million
- Court may order **dissolution** or **closure**

**Personal Liability for Managers (NEW):**
- Criminally liable if:
  - Had actual knowledge of offence, OR
  - Offence occurred due to breach of duties

---

### 6. FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT (FIU) POWERS EXPANDED

**Freezing Orders:**
- **30 days** (previously 7 days)
- Extendable by Public Prosecutor

**Seizure Orders:**
- **10 working days** suspension of transactions

---

### 7. LEGITIMATE SOURCE OF FUNDS - KEY ARTICLES

**Article 2, Clause 3:**
> "Conviction of the Predicate Offence shall not be required to establish the **illegitimate source** of the Proceeds"

**Implication:**

- "Innocent until proven guilty" weakened in practice

**Defense Must Show:**
1. Clear paper trail of funds
2. Legitimate business transactions
3. Tax declarations and compliance
4. Banking documentation
5. Source country legal compliance

---

### 8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

- Asset seizure/confiscation WITHOUT local investigation
- NO requirement for ratified convention
- Priority handling of international requests

**Key for Defense:**
- International fund transfers subject to scrutiny
- Multiple jurisdiction transfers raise suspicion
- Proper documentation CRITICAL

---

### 9. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE RIGHTS

**Public Prosecution Powers:**
- Can extend asset freezes
- Access to FIU financial analysis
- Inter-agency information sharing

**Defendant Rights:**
- Right to legal representation
- Right to present evidence

**Grievance Procedure:**

## 🎯 CRITICAL ISSUES FOR DEFENSE CASE

### Issue 1: TIMING OF OFFENCE vs. LAW

**Question:** When was accused convicted?
- Before 14 Oct 2025 → OLD LAW may apply
- After 14 Oct 2025 → NEW LAW applies

**Legal Principle:** *Lex mitior* (more lenient law should apply)

---

### Issue 2: KNOWLEDGE STANDARD

**Under NEW LAW:**
- "Sufficient evidence or circumstantial evidence"
- Objective test: "should have known"

**Defense Must Prove:**
- No reasonable grounds to suspect
- Due diligence performed
- Good faith belief in legitimacy

---

### Issue 3: BURDEN OF PROOF

**Prosecution Must Prove:**
- Funds are proceeds of predicate crime (can use circumstantial evidence)
- Defendant knew or should have known

**Defense Should Prove:**
- Legitimate source of funds
- Legal business transactions
- Compliance with source country laws
- Tax declarations filed

---

### Issue 4: "SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE"

**What constitutes sufficient evidence?**
- Multiple transfers?
- Cash transactions?
- Offshore accounts?
- Lack of documentation?

**Defense Counter:**
- Provide complete documentation
- Explain business rationale
- Show tax compliance
- Demonstrate legitimate wealth accumulation
