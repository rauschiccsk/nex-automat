## Key Legal Issues for Defense

### Knowledge Requirement (Article 2)

The law requires **"having the knowledge"** that funds are proceeds of a felony or misdemeanor. This is a **subjective mental element** that must be proven by prosecution.

### Predicate Offense Requirement

While Article 2(3) states that proving illicit source is not a prerequisite, **jurisprudence from Dubai Cassation Court** establishes that:
- There must be a predicate offense (either domestic or foreign)
- It must be established that funds originate from this offense
- This is a "presumed condition" for money laundering

### Intent Requirements

Per Dubai Cassation Court jurisprudence:
- **General intent:** Knowledge that funds are proceeds of crime
- **Special intent:** Aim to conceal/disguise the illegal origin

### Legitimate Source Defense

If funds can be proven to originate from legitimate sources (e.g., documented sale of companies, farms, livestock), this negates the fundamental element of the crime.
